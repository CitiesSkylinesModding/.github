# Cities Skylines Modding Organisation
### Objectives
* The organisation is maintained by modders from [Cities Skylines Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/ExfdGrYvS4) and it is a result of discussions of having a 'space' to share useful information for modding. This is an experimental project to support modding efforts and we have the intent to expand the goals later on based on how the initial reception goes. The goals are:
* Have a location/hub to share useful information regarding modding support and useful practices, outside less accessible and forgettable locations such as DMs, individual/private Discord servers etc. 
* Create and develop tutorials, guides for current and future mod content using pages. 

### What this organisation is not:
* It is not a hivemind, nor collective. It is maintained by individuals which their work is published and maintained under their names.
